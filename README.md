## Architectual Concepts

NMS Prime is written with PHP 5.6, [Laravel 5](https://laravel.com/) framework and a modern, cool and responsive [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) topic. It is tested and developed under CentOS 7 (RHEL 7).

NMS Prime is build by standard Linux tools, like
- [ISC DHCP](https://www.isc.org/downloads/dhcp/)
- [Named](https://linux.die.net/man/8/named)
- [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/)
- [Cacti](https://www.cacti.net/index.php)

These tools are worldwide developed, approved and used. See [Design Architecture](https://devel.roetzer-engineering.com:3128/confluence/display/NMS/Architecture+Guidelines) for more information
